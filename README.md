# Introduction

In this gitbook, I am going to log some of the SOTA ML methods I've been learning.


## Supervised vs Unsupervised Learning
A supervised model involves making prediction, e.g. given input variables $$x$$ and predict the output variables $$y$$. During the training phase, both $$(x,y)$$ are provided.
On the other hand, a unsupervised model is not trying to predict anything.A model is constructed by extracting or summarizing the patterns in the input data.

## Discriminative vs Generative Modeling
